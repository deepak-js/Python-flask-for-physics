# Python Flask for Physics

Everyone can get access to Python for free, and everyone can use online
resources to solve problems. I've also made it so that it doesn't require
Internet access and can be used by people who do not understand
programming languages. As a result, everyone can use this localhost site
absolutely free of charge and I hope it will save a lot of time for people who
look for solutions on the internet.
